# Dialect

Dialect is a website project created to practice and demonstrate my skills as a front-end developer. I followed a Figma [design](https://www.uihut.com/web-designs/language-learning-landing-page-ui-kit/22200) from [UIHUT](https://www.uihut.com) to build this website.

The live site is deployed on [Netlify](https://dialect-leocata.netlify.app/).
